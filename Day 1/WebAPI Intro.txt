		1. Cross platform Data exchange framework by Microsoft
		2. Successor to Advance web service
				Web Service - was all about SOAP message
					SOAP message were  very heavy, and thus look a lot of time and data
						to pass from 1 place to another, making it a bit slow
					Because - SOAP was more of Metadata and less of data

					eg. temperature
				<location type="string" value="mumbai:string"> </location>

					result
				<result>
					<temperature="25" type="int" ...></temperature>
		3. Thus in advance web serive, they changed SOAP to XML
				<location>Mumbai</location>
				<temperature>25</temperature>

		4. JSON - javascript object notation
					Mumbai
					25

		5. Web Services has another problem, which worked on HTTP, but did not rules of HTTP

		6. ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association, they came with JSON-plain text
			and W3C - which governs HTTP Protocol

			collabrated and made new standards for data exchange on WEB named it as 
				REST services 
			Representational State Transfer of data

			Microsoft went ahead accepted the standard, and create a framework on it
				classes, methods, compilerers, properties, attributes, formatters, serializers
				etc.

				and it named it as WebAPI
